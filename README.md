# BounceCat iOS game

Currently unfinished, but in my opinion game with great potential. 

I can tell for this game that has some kind of inovative concept which I didn't find on Apple store in time of writing this README file.

### Which features are implemented?

- Game physics
- Ability to break objects in scene (not animation way, it is implemented in more physics way)
- Ability to load levels and create objects and set their positions based on contents of ``json`` file
- Ability to "collect" things
- Ability for some object to pass through some other
- Tested on iPhone and iPad
- ARC enabled, no memory leaks
- Code refactored and project organized in order to make development of game easier
- I have detailed plan what to do next with game from this point (Currently the problem is lack of time and resources).

### Which libs game use?

- [Cocos2d](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone/)
- [Box2d](http://box2d.org/)
- [BreakableSprite-Cocos2D](https://github.com/ivpusic/BreakableSprite-Cocos2D/)
